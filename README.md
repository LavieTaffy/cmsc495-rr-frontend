---/* || About FRONTEND */---

- This frontend was built from the create-react-app initialization package
- I removed some of the boilerplate from folders generated from create-react-app

- If you wish to check out the frontend locally,
    1. Run npm start in the backend directory
    2. open your browser to http://localhost:3000
    3. To interact with both the UI/BACKEND at the SAME TIME, both need to be running, so you need to "npm start" both directories.
    4. You will need to make an account while the backend and the database is running. Ensure that Mongodb is installed before proceeding.
